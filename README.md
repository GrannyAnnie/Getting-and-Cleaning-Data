Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This describes the final project for the Getting and Cleaning Data class through Coursera.

The run_analysis.R file contains a script that uses data found here:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip



The dataset includes the following files:

1. 'ReadMe.md'

2. 'run_analysis.R' - contains the script that extracts the UCI HAR dataset, merges the training and the test sets into one data set, extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, adds descriptive activity names, labels the data set with descriptive variable names, and creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject (called tidy_data.txt)

3. 'CodeBook.md' -  describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data

4. 'tidy_data.txt' - file produced by running the 'run_analysis.R' script.
